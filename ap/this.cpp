What is true about the 'this' pointer

It is passed as a hidden argument to all non static function calls

'this' is a const pointer, so there is an error in line "this = t"


the delete operator opnly works for objects allocated using operator new...  If the object is created using new, then we can do 
delete this, otherwise behavior is undefined.
