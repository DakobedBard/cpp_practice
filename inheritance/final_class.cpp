/*

Java and C# have final classes built in.  Final classes cannot be inherited.  



How would we do this using C++?


 A program with compilation error to demonstrate that Final class cannot 
   be inherited 

*/

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class Final;  // The class to be made final
 
class MakeFinal // used to make the Final class final
{
  private:
    	MakeFinal() { cout << "MakFinal constructor" << endl; }
  friend class	Final;
};


 
class Final : virtual MakeFinal
{
  public:
    Final() { cout << "Final constructor" << endl; }
};
 
class Derived : public Final // Compiler error
{
  public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived constructor" << endl; }
};
 


int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    Derived d;
    return 0;
}
